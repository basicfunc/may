# May

May is application for testing APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests (GET and POST) to a specified URL and receive JSON responses. The app uses the `reqwest` crate for making HTTP requests and the `serde_json` crate for handling JSON data.

## Usage

1. Enter the desired HTTP request in the format of `METHOD URL`. For example, to send a GET request to `https://api.example.com/endpoint`, type: `GET https://api.example.com/endpoint`.

2. For POST requests, the app will prompt for a JSON body. Enter the JSON body to include in the request.

3. The app will display the response in a pretty-printed JSON format.

4. To exit the app, type `exit`.

## Features

### Upcoming Features

- Session history support: Maintain a history of API requests and responses for the current session.
- Addition of PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods: Extend support for additional HTTP methods.
- Session management: Enable session management to save and load previous sessions for easy recall.
